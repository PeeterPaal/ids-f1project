Dataset 1 (15 MB): Dataset of various Formula 1 data (circuits, results, teams etc.)  from 1950-2017 [1]
Dataset 2 (5 MB): Dataset of various Formula 1 data (circuits, results, teams etc.)  from 1950-2018 (less formatted) [2]

Goal 1: Gather some interesting data from 2012 season - one of the most interesting and even seasons in recent history.
Goal 2: Compare two of the sports most successful racers - Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.

If we have leftover time after working on the main 2 goals, also try to find ways to predict future results (qualifying, race etc.).
