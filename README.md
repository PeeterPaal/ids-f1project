### Datasets
 - Dataset 1 (5 MB): Dataset of various Formula 1 data (circuits, results, teams etc.)  from 1950-2018 [1]
 - Dataset 2 (15 MB): Dataset of various Formula 1 data (circuits, results, teams etc.)  from 1950-2017 (based on [1], better formatted) [2]


 ### Goals for this project:
 - Goal 1: Gather some interesting data from 2012 season - one of the most interesting and even seasons in recent history.

 - Goal 2: Compare two of the sports most successful racers - Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.


If we have leftover time after working on the main 2 goals, also try to find ways to predict future results (qualifying, race etc.).
